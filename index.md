This series of tutorial is aimed for people who are ready to dig deeper into the workings of Arduino. There will be special focus on Atmega328, which is the microcontroller at the heart of Adruino. 

We will be learning how to program in Embedded C (nah! people call it that but it's just regular C), to write efficient code and make best use of the resources offered by the humble Arduino.

Note again, this is not a beginner level tutorial.
